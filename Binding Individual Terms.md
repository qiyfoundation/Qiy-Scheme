# Binding Individual Terms

## Abstract
This document represents the general terms under which an [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) is prepared to consent to the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data)) within the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network).

## 1 General
Unless prescribed otherwise by law, any processing of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) shall comply with these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms).

## 2 Access
I shall have access to all of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) that is processed by a [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider).

## 3 Insight
I shall be able to easily gain insight in the present use of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data): who is processing my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data), for what purpose, how and under what agreements.
I shall also be able to easily gain insight in the past use of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data).

## 4 Control
I shall have control over all of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data):
1. I can choose to share my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data).
1. I shall have the right to end the processing of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) without undue delay, whenever I wish.
1. I shall have the right to obtain the erasure of my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) without undue delay, whenever I wish.

## 5 Provenance
I can share my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) in such a way that the authenticity, contents, originating source, the actuality, the validity, and the integrity of it can be reliably established and verified.
This way, I will not only be able to re-use my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data), but also to share [Verified Data](Definitions.md#verified-data) and/or [Verifiable Data](Definitions.md#verifiable-data).

## 6 Anonymity
I shall have the right to remain [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymous).

## 7 Consent
My [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) may only be processed with my freely given [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) and for specified purposes. My [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) may not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes.
I can withdraw my [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) at any time or, in the case of a contract, after the termination of the contract or the expiration of the period, specified in the contract, for which the consent was given. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

## 8 Transparency
When I am asked to provide [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) for an online service, I shall be clearly informed by the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) on the purposes for which the [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) will be used or may be used in the future. If the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, depends on my [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) for the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data), the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall explain to me why this is necessary. Only when fully informed, I can decide to make (part of) my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) available.

## 9 Data minimisation
The quantity and nature of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) requested by a [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) for which they are processed.

## 10 Online tracking
Online tracking is not permitted without my prior explicit [Consent](Definitions.md#consent).

## 11 Security Policy
Each [Service Provider](#Definitions.md#service-provider) shall ensure that [Personal Data](#Definitions.md#personal-data) are processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the [Personal Data](#Definitions.md#personal-data), including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. Each [Service Provider](#Definitions.md#service-provider) shall have an adequate security policy in place, based on the requirements imposed by or on behalf of the [Scheme Authority](#Definitions.md#scheme-authority).

## 12 Privacy statement Service Providers
[Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) accept that these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms) shall take precedence over their existing or future privacy statements where they offer me a higher protection and that the provisions of their privacy statements that are inconsistent with the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) and / or these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms), will be considered void. In the case where existing or future privacy statements of [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) offer a higher protection, those privacy statements will take precedence.

## 13 Complaints and disputes
In the event of a complaint or dispute, the first in line to be addressed shall be the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider). If this does not lead to a satisfactory solution, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the [Regional Authority](Definitions.md#regional-authority) (for now: [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)). Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall publish a clear and easy to find announcement on its website indicating to whom complaints can be addressed and whom to contact in case of a dispute.
The complaint procedure and the procedure for dispute resolution as prescribed by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority) or, in delegation by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority), as adopted by the [Regional Authority](Definitions.md#regional-authority) shall apply.
