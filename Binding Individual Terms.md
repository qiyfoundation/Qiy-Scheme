# Binding Individual Terms

## Abstract
This document represents the general terms under which an [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) is prepared to consent to the processing of [Information](#information) and/or [Data](Definitions.md#data) relating to the [Individual](#individual) (hence: [Relating Data](#relating-data)) within the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network). These terms are binding for all [Users](Definitions.md#user): [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms).

## 1 General
Processing of my [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) shall only be allowed on the basis of and in compliance with these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms).

## 2 Access
I shall have access to all of my [Relating Data](#relating-data) that is processed within the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) (hence: [Qiy Data](#qiy-data)).

## 3 Insight
I shall be able to easily gain insight in the present use of my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data): who is processing my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data), for what purpose, how and under what agreements.
I shall also be able to easily gain insight in the past use of my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data).

## 4 Control
I shall have control over all of my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data).
I can choose to share my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data) within the [Qiy Trust Network](#qiy-trust-network).

## 5 Provenance
I can share my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data) in such a way that the contents, originating source, the actuality, the validity, and the integrity of it can be reliably established and verified.
This way, I will not only be able to re-use my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data), but also to share [Validated Data](#validated-data) and/or [Verified Claims](#verified-claims).

## 6 Anonymity
I shall have the right to remain [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymous).
In transactions where I act anonymously, my [Qiy Data](#qiy-data) will be processed in a [Pseudonymised](#pseudonymisation) way (hence: [Pseudonymised Data](#pseudonymised-data)).
In transactions where I cannot act anonymously, I have the choice to either provide [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) or to abort the transaction. 
[Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) accept that the right to remain [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymous) is a basic premise in these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms).

## 7 Consent
Unless prescribed otherwise by law, my [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) may only be processed with my freely given [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) and for specified purposes. My [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) may not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Unless prescribed otherwise by law, I can withdraw my [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) at any time or, in the case of a contract, after the termination of the contract or the expiration of the period, specified in the contract, for which the consent was given. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

## 8 Transparency
When I am asked to provide [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) for an online service, I shall be clearly informed by the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) on the purposes for which the [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) will be used or may be used in the future. If the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, depends on my [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) for the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data), the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall explain to me why this is necessary.
Only when fully informed, I can decide to make (part of) my [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) available.

## 9 Data minimisation
The quantity and nature of the requested data must be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed.

## 10 Online tracking

Online tracking is not permitted without my prior explicit [Consent](Definitions.md#consent).

## 11 Erasure of Relating Data
Unless prescribed otherwise by law, I shall have the right to obtain the erasure of my [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) without undue delay, whenever I wish.

## 12 Security Policy
Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) must ensure that [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) are processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data), including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.
Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) must have an adequate security policy in place, based on the requirements imposed by or on behalf of the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority).

## 13 Privacy statement Service Providers
[Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) accept that the [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms) take precedence over their existing or future privacy statements where they offer me a higher protection and that the provisions of these statements that are inconsistent with the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) and these [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms) will be considered void. In the case where existing or future privacy statements of [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) offer a higher protection, these privacy statements will teke precendence.

## 14 Complaints and disputes
In the event of a complaint or dispute, the first in line to be addressed shall be the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider). If this does not lead to a satisfactory solution, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the [Regional Authority](Definitions.md#regional-authority) (for now: [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)). Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall publish a clear and easy to find announcement on its website indicating to whom complaints can be addressed and whom to contact in case of a dispute.
The complaint procedure and the procedure for dispute resolution as prescribed by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority) or, in delegation by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority), as adopted by the [Regional Authority](Definitions.md#regional-authority) shall apply.
