This document is a policy document which describes what the requirements are for new releases of the Qiy Scheme and how these new releases are managed.

# 2 
The Supervisory Authority of the Qiy Foundation decides upon the release of updates and new version of the different elements (governance, legal and technical) of the Qiy Scheme.

## 2.1 Governance
The governance model of the Qiy Scheme is based on a separation of powers and on checks and balances. The governing bodies of the Qiy Foundation are required to respect and maintain this model and to improve it whenever possible or required. All those who make use of the Qiy Scheme are required to co-operate in full with the governing bodies and with the auditors in upholding this model.

## 2.2 Legal
New versions of the rules & regulations governing the Qiy Scheme will automatically apply from the date specified in the published version. The license agreement between the Qiy Foundation and Access Providers shall contain an obligation for Access Providers to ensure that their clients are aware of this and that their clients agree to respect this rule and shall act accordingly.

## 2.2 Technical protocols
The technical protocols are essential for the functioning of the Qiy Trust Network as a whole as these guarantee interoperability.
Amendments to the technical protocols that relate to security need to be implemented immediately.
Essential adaptations shall be announced timely in order to grant those who are connected to the Qiy Trust Network ample time to adjust their settings or to take other measures to implement the changes.
In some cases, adjustments may only be recommended, especially in cases where these do not affect the interoperability and functionality of the system. In such cases, upgrading to a newer version shall be optional.
