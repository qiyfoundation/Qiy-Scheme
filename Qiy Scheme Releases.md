# Qiy Scheme releases

## Abstract
The Qiy Scheme defines a framework for individual users, companies and governmental organisations to safely control and exchange personal data. This document describes what the requirements are for new releases of the Qiy Scheme and how these new releases are managed.

# 1 Qiy Scheme: new releases
This document is a policy document which describes the requirements for new releases of the Qiy Scheme and how these new releases are managed.

# 2 Versioning
The Supervisory Authority of the Qiy Foundation decides upon the release of new versions of the Qiy Scheme:
* The Supervisory Authority will release a major version when it introduces incompatible changes.
* The Supervisory Authority will release a minor version when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
* The Supervisory Authority will release a patch version for backwards-compatible (bug) fixes.

# 3 Rules
New versions of the Qiy Scheme will apply from the date of release.
The Supervisory Authority will follow these rules:
* Major versions shall be announced timely in order to grant those who are connected to the Qiy Trust Network ample time to adjust their settings or to take other measures to implement the changes.
* Minor versions shall not be announced and upgrading to a newer version shall be optional.
* Patch versions shall not be announced.

## 3.1 Governance
The governance model of the Qiy Scheme is based on a separation of powers and on checks and balances. The governing bodies of the Qiy Foundation are required to respect and maintain this model and to improve it whenever possible or required. All those who make use of the Qiy Scheme are required to co-operate in full with the governing bodies and with the auditors in upholding this model.

## 3.2 Legal
The license agreement between the Qiy Foundation and Access Providers shall contain an obligation for Access Providers to ensure that their clients are aware of this and that their clients agree to respect this rule and shall act accordingly.

## 3.3 Technical protocols
Amendments to the technical protocols that relate to security need to be implemented immediately.
