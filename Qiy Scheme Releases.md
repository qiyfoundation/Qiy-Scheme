# Qiy Scheme releases

## Abstract
The [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) defines a framework for individual users, companies and governmental organisations to safely control and exchange personal data. This document describes what the requirements are for new releases of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) and how these new releases are managed.

# 1 Qiy Scheme: new releases
This document is a policy document which describes the requirements for new releases of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) and how these new releases are managed.

# 2 Versioning
The [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board) of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) decides upon the release of new versions of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme):
* The [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board) will release a major version when it introduces incompatible changes.
* The [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board) will release a minor version when functionality is added in a backwards-compatible manner.
* The [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board) will release a patch version for backwards-compatible (bug) fixes.

# 3 Rules
New versions of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) will apply from the date of release.
The [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board) will follow these rules:
* Major versions shall be announced timely in order to grant those who are connected to the Qiy Trust Network ample time to adjust their settings or to take other measures to implement the changes.
* Minor versions shall not be announced and upgrading to a newer version shall be optional.
* Patch versions shall not be announced.

## 3.1 Governance
The [Governance Model](Governance%02Model.md) of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) is based on a separation of powers and on checks and balances. The governing bodies of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) are required to respect and maintain this model and to improve it whenever possible or required. All those who make use of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) are required to co-operate in full with the governing bodies and with the auditors in upholding this model.

## 3.2 Legal
The license agreement between the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) and [Access Providers](Definitions.md#access-provider) shall contain an obligation for [Access Providers](Definitions.md#access-provider) to ensure that their clients are aware of this and that their clients agree to respect this rule and shall act accordingly.

## 3.3 Technical protocols
Amendments to the technical protocols that relate to security shall be announced as such and need to be implemented immediately.
