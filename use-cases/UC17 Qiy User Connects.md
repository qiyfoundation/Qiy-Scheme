# Primary Actors

* [Proposer](../Definitions.md#proposer): A [Qiy User](../Definitions.md#qiy-user) 
* [Accepter](../Definitions.md#accepter): A [Qiy User](../Definitions.md#qiy-user)
* [Qiy Trust Network](../Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network)

# Preconditions

1. [Proposer](../Definitions.md#proposer) has access to the [Qiy Trust Network](../Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network).
1. [Accepter](../Definitions.md#accepter) has access to the [Qiy Trust Network](../Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network).

# Basic Flow

## 1. Proposer acquires a Connect Token from Qiy Trust Network
## 2. Proposer creates a Connect Proposal containing the Connect Token
## 3. Proposer provides Accepter with Connect Proposal
## 4. Accepter extracts Connect Token from Connect Proposal
## 5. Accepter asks Qiy Trust Network to create a Connection using the Connect Token

# Postconditions

1. [Proposer](../Definitions.md#proposer) and [Accepter](../Definitions.md#accepter) have a new [Connection](../Definitions.md#connection).

# Extensions

## Ways to Connect
[Qiy Users](../Definitions.md#qiy-user) can use different media to connect as illustrated in this diagram:

![Media](./images/Connect.png)

 
### Connect using Connect Token in a website address
[Qiy Users](../Definitions.md#qiy-user) can connect by transfering the [Connect Token](../Definitions.md#connect-token) as a query parameter in a website address:
 
![Connect using a token in a website address](../images/connect-using-a-token-in-a-website-address.png)

### Representing the Connect Token as a QR Code

The picture below shows a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) that is generated by an [Individual](../Definitions.md#individual) using a mobile app containing a QR Code.
The [Individual](../Definitions.md#individual) can use this proposal to invite other [Individuals](../Definitions.md#individual) to connect.

### Email
The picture below shows an example of a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) in an email:

![An example of a Connect Proposal in an email](../images/example--connect-proposal--email.PNG)

### Webpage with QR Code
The picture below shows an example of a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) in a webpage which displays a QR code when viewed on a laptop, pc or tablet:

![An example of a Connect Proposal in a webpage with QR code](../images/example--connect-proposal--webpage-laptop-pc-tablet.PNG)

### Webpage with Connect-button
The picture below shows an example of a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) in a webpage which displays a button when viewed on smartphone:

![An example of a Connect Proposal in a webpage with button](../images/example--connect-proposal--webpage-phone.PNG)

### Connect by scanning a QR code

The picture below shows an example of scanning the QR code in a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) using a [Qiy Application](../Definitions.md#qiy-application):

![An example of scanning a QR code](../images/example--connect-proposal--scan-qr-code.PNG)

### Connect with a button click

When an [Accepter](../Definitions.md#accepter) has viewed a webpage with a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal) on his phone and clicked the button to accept it, he will be asked to confirm that he will be redirected to a [Qiy Application](../Definitions.md#qiy-application):

![An example of confirming the redirect to a Qiy Application](../images/example--connect-proposal--after-the-button-click.PNG)

### Connect using print

[Qiy Users](../Definitions.md#qiy-user) can convert the [Token](../Definitions.md#token) to a QR Code and use various 'Print'-media to connect:

![Present proposal containing a QR Code](../images/present-proposal-containing-a-qr-code.png)


The QR Code can be used as follows to create the [Connection](../Definitions.md#connection):
 
![Connect using a QR Code](../images/connect-using-a-qr-code.png)
 

### Confirmation

The picture below shows an example of an [Qiy Application](../Definitions.md#qiy-application) verifying the acceptance of a [Connect Proposal](../Definitions.md#connect-proposal).
The [Qiy Application](../Definitions.md#qiy-application) will create the [Connection](../Definitions.md#connection) when the [Accepter](../Definitions.md#accepter) has confirmed that he wants to connect with the [Proposer](../Definitions.md#proposer).

## 1.1 Proposer creates Connect Token

Instead of acquiring a Connect Token from the Qiy Trust Network, the Proposer can also create a Connect Token himself, see [UC21 Qiy User Creates Connect Token](UC21%20Qiy%20User%20Creates%20Connect%20Token.md).
