# Qiy Scheme Definitions


## Abstract

The [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme) is a global system for the exchange of [Data](#data) under the control of the [Individual](#individual). It consists of technical protocols, regulations and a governance model. Together these safeguard and promote interoperability between interconnected [Entities](#entity) on the [Qiy Trust Network](#qiy-trust-network). All services that are developed on the basis of the [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme) are interoperable and interconnect through an independent and distributed [Qiy Trust Network](#qiy-trust-network): [Data](#data) can be exchanged seamlessly between the different services. [Individuals](#individual) are in control of the exchange: they can establish secure 1-on-1 trust network connections with other [Individuals](#individual), with organisations and even with devices and products (Internet of Things) of their choice. Through those connections they can access their [Data](#data) and, if they wish, forward this [Data](#data) to others who will be able to verify the validity of the [Data](#data) received. On the basis of the [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme) market parties can develop their own trust services for the secure exchange of [Data](#data).
This document defines the terms used by the [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme). All [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme) documents refer to these terms.
