# What is the Qiy Scheme?
The Qiy Scheme defines a framework for individual users, companies and governmental organisations to safely control and exchange personal data.

## The Qiy Scheme Rulebook
The Qiy Scheme Rulebook consists of a set of documents concerning governance, legal and technical issues. The evolution of the rules is a dynamic and continuous process.

## Work Streams
The maintenance and development of the Qiy Scheme is delegated to appointed Work Streams.

# Git-Flow
Git-Flow is a set of conventions about how to work with Git and adopted by the Work Streams. It defines workflows for the most common tasks - like starting & finishing topics, hotfixes or releases. To learn more about this branching strategy and release management, have a look at blog posts like [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).

Conventions used:

* Feature and topic branch prefix: **topic/**
* Hotfix branch prefix: **hotfix/**
* Release branch prefix: **review-board/**
