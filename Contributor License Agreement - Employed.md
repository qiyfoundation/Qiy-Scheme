# Contributor License Agreement
(for individuals with an employment relationship)

# Context
The Qiy Foundation is the custodian of the Qiy Scheme. 
The different elements, which constitute the Qiy Scheme, are jointly developed by Contributors under the supervision of the Qiy Foundation.

# Transfer of ownership and control
It is essential to clarify the ownership and control over and the use of intellectual property rights (hereinafter – 'IPR') and other forms of ownership or control in regard to Contributions by any person participating in the development of the Qiy Scheme (hereinafter - 'Contributor'). For this reason, each Contributor must sign a Contributor License Agreement (hereinafter – 'CLA'). The terms of this CLA are based upon and implement the Qiy Foundation's IPR Policy Rules and Guidelines.

This CLA sets forth the terms under which a Contributor agrees to participate in the above development processes. 
Each Contributor grants a non-exclusive license to the Qiy Foundation as specified in this CLA, in respect of any Contribution, which may qualify as an original work under copyright law. The collective rights in the work, which is created by or on the basis of Contributions submitted by Contributors, will be vested exclusively in the Qiy Foundation. In return, the Qiy Foundation shall grant Contributors the necessary rights that they may need in order to use the works to which they contributed, for their own commercial or non-commercial purposes. However, their use of those rights must not conflict with or modify the development process which takes place under this CLA. Except for the limited definitions specifically referenced herein, this CLA sets forth the Contributor's entire licensing obligations and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements, understandings, and obligations with respect thereto.

Signing this CLA is for your protection as a Contributor as well as for the protection of the Qiy Foundation and the users of the Qiy Trust Network; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.

# Confidentiality
In the process of developing the Qiy Scheme, Parties may exchange confidential information. If that is the case, it is important that they agree upon mutual confidentiality and non-disclosure of such information. Therefore, Contributors may be asked to sign a separate Mutual Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreement, which will then become an integral part of this CLA.
