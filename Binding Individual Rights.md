# Binding Individual Rights

## Abstract

In the [Work Stream Legal and Governance](Definitions.md#work-stream-legal-and-governance) has been agreed to mirror the [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) that apply to [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider) and / or [Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) in a paper for [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) who use the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework), where the parent text is the [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) document.
The [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) are designed and administered by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority) (for now the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)). The [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) is required by the license agreement to include the [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) in its contracts with [Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) and [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider). The following document represents the [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) in [Binding Individual Rights](Definitions.md#binding-individual-right). It aims to inform the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) about his / her rights within the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework), and takes the form of a charter.
This text was first written in Dutch and then translated into English.


# Rights of the individual  in regard to the availability and use of personal data within the Qiy Trust Framework

## Charter of Individual Rights

The following charter defines the rights of the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) when exchanging [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) with other parties via the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework). In particular, this charter supervises all forms of [Data](Definitions.md#data) exchange between an [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) and a third party offering its [Services](Definitions.md#service) within the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework) (called [Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) and [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider)).

## 1 My data
My [Data](Definitions.md#data) may be used with my permission only, including the [Data](Definitions.md#data) I personally provide. This might be [Data](Definitions.md#data) that I created myself or [Data](Definitions.md#data) available to me by the association with one or more third parties (so called [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider)).

## 2 Permission
When I am asked to provide [Data](Definitions.md#data) for a particular online [Service](Definitions.md#service), I will be clearly informed by the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) on the purpose for which the [Data](Definitions.md#data) will be used now and in the future. The amount and nature of the requested [Data](Definitions.md#data) must be reasonable in relation to the purpose for which I am providing this [Data](Definitions.md#data). Only when fully informed, I can decide to make (part of) my (validated and / or anonymous) [Data](Definitions.md#data) available. This may be [Data](Definitions.md#data) that I created myself or [Data](Definitions.md#data) given to me by the association with third parties (so called [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider)). The information may be used only for the purpose for which I have provided my [Data](Definitions.md#data).

## 3 Anonymity

I always have the ability to maintain my anonymity. I can also share validated [Data](Definitions.md#data) anonymously. In transactions where I cannot act anonymously, I have the choice to either provide identifying information or to abort the transaction. All [Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) and [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider) of the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework) accept the basic premise of anonymity as described above. This is part of the contract with them.

## 4 Online tracking

Online tracking is not permitted without my prior permission. 

## 5 Removal of data

Whenever I wish, and on the condition that my [Data](Definitions.md#data) should not be preserved under existing law or regulation, my [Data](Definitions.md#data) is deleted upon my request. In all cases, [Data](Definitions.md#data) which are no longer required are to be removed after a period of 6 months.

## 6 Security Policy

Each [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) and / or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider) that uses my [Data](Definitions.md#data) or makes my [Data](Definitions.md#data) available has an adequate security policy implemented, according the requirements imposed by the [Global Authority](Definitions.md#global-authority).

## 7 Privacy statement Relying Parties and Data Providers

[Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) and [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider) accept that the [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) take precedence over existing or future own privacy statements and that the provisions of these statements that are inconsistent with the [Qiy Trust Framework](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-framework) and this Charter will be considered void.

## 8 Complaints and disputes

### a. Complaints and disputes

In the event of a complaint or dispute, the first contact is the [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider). If this does not lead to a satisfactory solution, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the [Regional Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#regional-scheme-authority) (for now: [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)). Each [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) and / or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider) has a clear section on its website where I can go with my complaints and disputes. 

### b. Disputes Committee

When the [Regional Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#regional-scheme-authority) does not resolve the complaint or dispute to my satisfaction, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the [Disputes Committee](Definitions.md#disputes-committee).
