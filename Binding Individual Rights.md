The information may be used only for the purpose for which I have provided my [Data].

[Relying Parties] and [Data Providers] accept that the [Qiy Trust Principles] take precedence over existing or future own privacy statements and that the provisions of these statements that are inconsistent with the [Qiy Trust Framework] and this Charter will be considered void.

## 8 Complaints and disputes

In the event of a complaint or dispute, the first contact is the [Relying Party] or [Data Provider].
