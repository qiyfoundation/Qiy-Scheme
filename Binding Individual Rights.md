# Binding Individual Rights

## Abstract

In the Work Stream Legal and Governance has been agreed to mirror the Binding Principles that apply to Data Providers and / or Relying Parties in a paper for individuals who use the Qiy Trust Network, where the parent text is the Binding Principles document.
The Binding Principles are designed and administered by the Scheme Authority (for now the Qiy Foundation). The Service Provider is required by the license agreement to include the Binding Principles in its contracts with Relying Parties and Data Providers. The following document represents the Binding Principles in Binding Individual Rights. It aims to inform the individual about his / her rights within the Qiy Trust Network, and takes the form of a charter.
This text was first written in Dutch and then translated into English.


# Rights of the individual  in regard to the availability and use of personal data within the Qiy Trust Network

## Charter of Individual Rights

The following charter defines the rights of the individual when exchanging personal data with other parties via the Qiy Trust Network. In particular, this charter supervises all forms of data exchange between an individual and a third party offering its services within the Qiy Trust Network (called Relying Parties and Data Providers).

## 1 My data
My data may be used with my permission only, including the data I personally provide. This might be data that I created myself or data available to me by the association with one or more third parties (so called Data Providers).

## 2 Permission
When I am asked to provide data for a particular online service, I will be clearly informed by the service provider on the purpose for which the data will be used now and in the future. The amount and nature of the requested data must be reasonable in relation to the purpose for which I am providing this data. Only when fully informed, I can decide to make (part of) my (validated and / or anonymous) data available. This may be data that I created myself or data given to me by the association with third parties (so called Data Providers). The information may be used only for the purpose for which I have provided my data.

## 3 Anonymity

I always have the ability to maintain my anonymity. I can also share validated data anonymously. In transactions where I cannot act anonymously, I have the choice to either provide identifying information or to abort the transaction. All relying parties and data providers of the Qiy Trust Network accept the basic premise of anonymity as described above. This is part of the contract with them.

## 4 Online tracking

Online tracking is not permitted without my prior permission. 

## 5 Removal of data

Whenever I wish, and on the condition that my data should not be preserved under existing law or regulation, my data is deleted upon my request. In all cases, data which are no longer required are to be removed after a period of 6 months.

## 6 Security Policy

Each Relying Party and / or Data Provider that uses my data or makes my data available has an adequate security policy implemented, according the requirements imposed by the Global Authority.

## 7 Privacy statement Relying Parties and Data Providers

Relying Parties and Data Providers accept that the Qiy Trust Principles take precedence over existing or future own privacy statements and that the provisions of these statements that are inconsistent with the Qiy Trust Network and this Charter will be considered void.

## 8 Complaints and disputes

### a. Complaints and disputes

In the event of a complaint or dispute, the first contact is the Relying Party or Data Provider. If this does not lead to a satisfactory solution, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the Regional Scheme Authority (for now: Qiy Foundation). Each Relying Party and / or Data Provider has a clear section on its website where I can go with my complaints and disputes. 

### b. Disputes Committee

When the Regional Scheme Authority does not resolve the complaint or dispute to my satisfaction, the complaint or dispute may be submitted to the Disputes Committee.
