# 1 Qiy Scheme
This document describes the process of further development of the Qiy Scheme. The Qiy Scheme is a global system for the exchange of personal data under the control of the individual. It consists of technical protocols, regulations and a governance model. The Qiy Scheme is an open standard and a set of technical, operational and business rules and agreements which fosters interoperability between the interconnected persons, organisations, products, services and devices, which enables the exchange of data between Data Providers, Individuals and Relying Parties under the control of the Individual. The Qiy Scheme regulates issues such as, functionality, security, reliability levels, access criteria, communication, liabilities and availability.

# 2 Qiy Trust Network
The Qiy Scheme forms the basis of the Qiy Trust Network: the technical infrastructure which is based on an open standard and which respects the rules and regulations of the Qiy Scheme. The Qiy Trust Network makes it possible to exchange between individuals, organisations, products, services and devices in a safe and secure manner, personal data to which an Individual can connect on the basis of the Qiy Scheme. Market parties that respect the requirements of the Qiy Scheme, may build their own trust infrastructure and connect it to the Qiy Trust Network.

# 3 Scheme Authority
The Qiy Scheme is managed by the Qiy Foundation, which fulfills the role of Scheme Authority. The Qiy Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation with a governance model that makes it independent from market forces and political influence. The organisation is funded by annual contributions from Member organisations. The Qiy Foundation works closely together with national and international parties in the public and private sectors to enrich and maintain the Qiy Scheme. 

# 4 Development process
The development process starts at the level of Work Streams. Everyone is free to contribute their suggestions to the Work Streams.The process ends by an instruction of the Supervisory Authority to merge new elements with the existing version of the Qiy Scheme.
