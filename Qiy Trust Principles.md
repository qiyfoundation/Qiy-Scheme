# Qiy Trust Principles 

## Abstract

This document defines the basic principles that underlie the [Qiy Scheme](#qiy-scheme) and which apply to all processing activities of [Personal Data](#personal-data) by [Users](#user), via the [Qiy Trust Network](#qiy-trust-network). All [Users](#user) must respect the [Qiy Trust Principles](#qiy-trust-principles). Through the [License Agreement Access Provider](#license-agreement-access-provider), an [Access Provider](#access-provider) is required to incorporate the [Qiy Trust Principles](#qiy-trust-principles) into its contracts with [Service Providers](#service-provider). The [Qiy Trust Principles](#qiy-trust-principles) are also reflected in the [Binding Individual Terms](#binding-individual-terms).

6. If a [Service Provider](#service-provider) wants to process [Personal Data](#personal-data), it shall inform the [Individual](#individual) whom it concerns in advance, in clear and plain language, of the [Legitimate Purpose](#legitimate-purpose) and the frequency of the envisaged processing activities.

7. A [Service Provider](#service-provider]) shall not ask for more [Personal Data](#personal-data) than strictly necessary for the specified [Legitimate Purpose(s)](#legitimate-purpose).

9. When a [Relying Party](#relying-party) requests [Validated Data](#validated-data) or a [Verifiable Attribute](#verifiable-attribute) it shall ascertain in advance that this is really necessary for the [Legitimate Purpose(s)](#legitimate-purpose) on which the requrest is based.

10.
