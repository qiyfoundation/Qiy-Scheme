# Qiy Trust Principles 

## Abstract

This document defines the basic principles that underlie the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) and which apply to all processing activities of [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) by [Users](Definitions.md#user), via the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network). All [Users](Definitions.md#user) must respect the [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles). Through the [License Agreement Access Provider](Definitions.md#license-agreement-access-provider), an [Access Provider](Definitions.md#access-provider) is required to incorporate the [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) into its contracts with [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider). The [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) are also reflected in the [Binding Individual Terms](Definitions.md#binding-individual-terms).

[Users](Definitions.md#user) shall only be connected to the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) if, and for as long as they uphold the following principles which are fundamental to the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme):

1. An [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) who connects to a [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) through the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) shall remain [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymous) until such moment that (s)he chooses to reveal [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) for a specific [Legitimate Purpose](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose). [Verified Claims](Definitions.md#verified-claim) and [Validated Data](Definitions.md#validated-data) can also be shared anonymously. In transactions where an [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) cannot remain [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymous), the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) shall have the choice to either provide [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) or to abort the transaction.

2. Within the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network), unless prescribed otherwise by law, [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) may be processed only with the explicit [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) of the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) concerned. This applies regardless of the source of the [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data). 

3. [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) for the processing of [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) can either be refused or given, and be given for single use or for a certain period. Unless otherwise prescribed by law, or in the terms of a contract, [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) given can be revoked at any time.

4. [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) may only share [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) with other [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) or [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) with the explicit [Consent](Definitions.md#consent) of the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) whose [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) it concerns. 

5. [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) who are connected to the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) shall have online electronic [Access](Definitions.md#access) to their [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) which are processed by [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider). As a result, they shall be able to control and manage the use of their [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) as they deem fit.

6. If a [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) wants to process [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data), it shall inform the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) whom it concerns in advance, in clear and plain language, of the [Legitimate Purpose](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose) and the frequency of the envisaged processing activities.

7. A [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall not ask for more [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) than strictly necessary for the specified [Legitimate Purpose(s)](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose). A party connected to the [Qiy Trust Network](#qiy-trust-network) shall only process [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) for the [Legitimate Purpose(s)](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose) for which it has been made available.

9. When a [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) requests [Validated Data](Definitions.md#validated-data) or a [Verified Claim](Definitions.md#verified-claim) it shall ascertain in advance that this is really necessary for the [Legitimate Purpose(s)](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose) on which the requrest is based.

10. Unless prescribed otherwise by law, a [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall not store the [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) for a longer period than necessary for the specified [Legitimate Purpose(s)](Definitions.md#legitimate-purpose) for which the [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) has been made available.

11. [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider]) shall give [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) access to any and all [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) that they process regarding the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) concerned. 

12. Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall ensure that [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data) are processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the [Relating Data](Definitions.md#relating-data), including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures.

13. Each [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) shall have an adequate security policy in place, based on the requirements imposed by or on behalf of the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority). 

14. All [Legal Entities](Definitions.md#legal-entity) operating under the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) shall be audited periodically according to the rules and regulations of the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority). 

15. Each [Legal Entity](Definitions.md#legal-entity) that is connected to the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) shall implement the [Qiy Standard](Definitions.md#qiy-standard) according to the requirements of the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority).

16. All [Users](Definitions.md#user) shall comply with the rules and regulations of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme) in both writing and spirit.

17. These [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) take precedence over the privacy statements of [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider), to the extent that the [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) offer a higher protection to [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual). In the case where a privacy statement of a [Service Providers](Definitions.md#service-provider) offers a higher protection to [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) than the [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles), the former shall apply.
