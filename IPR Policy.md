# 1 IPR Policy
This document provides an overview of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s approach to intellectual property rights (IPRs). It is based on the ETSI policy document on Intellectual Property Rights of 19 September 2013. 
Intellectual property rights (IPR) play an important role in standardization processes. It is important for all parties involved in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s standards-making process to be aware of their responsibilities and to ensure that there is good collaboration between all parties. 

# 2 Objective
The objective of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy is to facilitate the standards making process within the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). The policy has been drafted to avoid that Contributors to the Work stream Functionality & Technology and persons contributing in any other way to the further development of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme), become involved in a legal discussion on IPR matters. 

# 3 Characteristics
The main characteristics of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy are the following:
* Contributors are fully entitled to hold and benefit from any IPRs which they may own, including the right to refuse the granting of licenses;
* it is the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s objective to create, as part of the [Qiy Scheme](Definitions.md#qiy-scheme), a Standard and Specifications that are based on solutions which best meet the technical objectives of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation);
* in achieving these objectives, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy seeks a balance between the needs of standardization for public use and the rights of the owners of IPRs;
* the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy seeks to reduce the risk that investment in the preparation, adoption and application of standards could be wasted as a result of IPR that is essential for a standard or technical specification (hereinafter: 'Essential IPR') being unavailable ('Essential IPR' means that it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the time of standardization, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate equipment, software or methods which comply with a Standard without infringing that IPR. Where a Standard can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which are infringements of IPRs, all such IPRs shall be considered 'Essential');
* Therefore, the knowledge of the existence of Essential IPRs is required as early as possible within the standards making process, especially in the case where licenses are not available under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (hereinafter: 'FRAND') terms and conditions.

The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy is intended to ensure that IPRs are identified timely, so as to avoid wasting effort on the elaboration of a Specification, which could subsequently be blocked by an Essential IPR.

# 4 Scope
In the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy an IPR includes:
* copyright;
* models/templates/formats;
* patents;
* trademarks;
* industrial designs;
* and applications thereof.

# 5 Rights and obligations deriving from the Qiy Foundation's IPR Policy 
The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy defines rights and obligations for the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) as the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority), for Contributors and for the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat). 

The following table intends to give a clear overview of the most important rights and obligations of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) as the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority), the Contributors,the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) and the rights of third parties as specified under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy. 

## 5.1 Organisation

### 5.1.1 Obligations
* to inform users of standards about Essential IPRs declared and ensure that this information is publicly available;
* to perform IPR searches if the EU and/or [EFTA](Definitions.md#efta) so require and reasonable expenses are met;
* to grant licenses on [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)-owned IPRs (other than copyright) on FRAND terms and conditions;
* to respect confidential information until publication of the relevant Specification.

### 5.1.2 Rights

## 5.2 Contributor

### 5.2.1 Obligations
* to inform [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s about their own, and  other people's Essential IPRs; 
* owners of Essential IPRs are requested to undertake to grant licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms and conditions;
* owners of Essential IPRs who refuse to grant a license when no alternative is available, are requested to reconsider their position and provide the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) with a justification;
* to abstain from claiming copyright on standards documentation (text, graphics etc., of the standard itself) on behalf of the Contributor itself and its employees.

### 5.2.2 Rights
* no obligation to conduct IPR searches;
* to refuse the inclusion of own IPRs in standard;
* to be granted licenses on FRAND terms and conditions in respect of a standard;
* to make copies of standards documentation free of charge;
* to use IPRs owned by [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s free of charge;
* to have confidential information respected until publication of the relevant Specification.

## 5.3 Secretariat

### 5.3.1 Obligations
* the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) to contact on behalf of [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation), owners of Essential IPRs having refused to grant licenses;
* the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) to request the owner of an Essential IPR to give within three months an undertaking in writing that it is prepared to grant licenses.

### 5.3.2 Rights

## 5.4 Third Party

### 5.4.1 Obligations
* the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy is only binding on [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Contributors. Third parties do not have any legal obligations under the Policy;
* when the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) is informed that an IPR belonging to a non-Contributor could be essential for a standard, the non-Contributor owner is also requested to undertake to grant licenses on FRAND terms and conditions.

### 5.4.2 Rights
* to refuse the inclusion of their own Essential IPRs in Specifications;
* to be granted licenses on FRAND terms and conditions in respect of a standard;
* to be granted licenses for [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) owned IPRs (other than copyright in the standard documentation) on FRAND terms and conditions;
* to have confidential information respected until publication of the relevant Specification.

# 6 Contributors' duties
Contributors participating in the Work stream Functionality & Technology shall respond at the earliest possible time to the call for IPRs performed by the Chairperson of the Work Stream at the beginning of each meeting, based on the working knowledge of the participants.

Furthermore, the call for IPRs acts as a reminder of the Contributor's obligations under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy and is performed to foster the disclosure of Essential IPRs in a timely fashion. 

The main problems for [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) as a standards body which may arise from 'late disclosures' include:
* licenses for patents which have been disclosed late and are not available at all; or, 
* licenses for patents which have been disclosed late and which are available, but not on FRAND terms, i.e. the company is unwilling to make a FRAND licensing declaration.

If the above issues cannot be satisfactorily resolved, then the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) has to change the standard, which in some extreme cases could even include the need to start again with the development of that standard. 

Intentional delays, where proven, should be treated as a breach of the IPR Policy and can be sanctioned by the [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board), in consultation with the [Executive Board](Definitions.md#executive-board).

'Intentional Delay' arises when it can be demonstrated that a Contributor has deliberately withheld IPR disclosures significantly beyond what would be expected from normal considerations of timely disclosure.

This description of 'Intentional Delay' should be interpreted in a way that is consistent with the current [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy. In complying with the requirements of timeliness, Contributors and others whom it may concern are recommended to make IPR disclosures at the earliest possible time following their becoming aware of IPRs which are, or are likely to become, Essential.

Contributors with IPR portfolios should improve their internal IPR co-ordination processes to ensure, as far as possible, that their participants in the Work Stream Functionality & Technology are aware of any alleged-essential IPR the company may have (related to the on-going work on a particular Specification), that they understand their obligations, and that they know how to discharge them.

Contributors are encouraged to make general IPR undertakings/licensing declarations that they will make licenses available for all their IPRs under FRAND terms and conditions related to a specific standardization area and then, as soon as feasible, provide (or refine) detailed disclosures. This process reduces the risk of the standards making process being blocked due to IPR constraints.

Contributors are not obliged to inform [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) of any updates to their essential IPRs.

Furthermore, Contributors do NOT have a duty to: 
* conduct IPR searches;
* disclose within the Technical Work Stream Functionality & Technology the commercial terms for licenses for which they have undertaken to grant licenses under FRAND terms and conditions. Any such commercial terms are a matter for discussion between the IPR holder and the potential licensee, outside of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation).

# 7 Copyrights in Specifications 
The ownership of the copyright in the Qiy Standard and Specifications, documentation and reports created by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) or any of its Work Streams shall vest in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). Specifications are considered as a 'collective work', which shall mean a work created at the initiative of a legal person (i.e. [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)) who edits it, publishes it and discloses it under its direction and name and in which the personal contributions of the various authors who participated in its production are merged in the overall work for which they were conceived, without it being possible to attribute to each author a separate right in the work as created. Accordingly, such collective work copyrights belong to [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation).

Hence, Contributors should be aware that once a technical proposal has been included into a Specification the copyright in this Specification is owned by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). However, the copyright in the individual contribution remains with the Contributor. Nevertheless, individual Contributors will need to sign a (non-exclusive) perpetual license that will allow the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) to use the above individual contributions to a Specification as part of the Qiy Standard. In the case where a Contributor is not an individual, but a company (or other type of organisation) hired by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) to contribute to the development of the Qiy Standard or to a Specification, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) will insist upon a transfer of ownership of all the rights which may be created by that company in the framework of their work for the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation).

Furthermore, contributions which are not intended to be a part of the collective work as defined above shall be duly acknowledged by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation).

# 8 Work Stream Functionality & Technology Chairperson's duties 
In the Work Stream Functionality & Technology, the Chairperson represents the interests of all Contributors as well as the interests of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). The Chairperson has an important role in respect of both the identification and the disclosure of Essential IPRs. He or she has a duty to remind the Contributors of their statutory obligations to submit IPR disclosures.

In addition to the actions aiming at the identification of IPRs, the Chairperson also needs to take the following actions, which ensure that the disclosure of essential IPRs is properly carried out:
* to record in the report of the meeting that an IPR call has been made and to record any responses;
* to inform the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) of the existence of any essential IPRs identified.

Also, the Chairperson shall not allow any discussion on commercial issues in the Work Stream Functionality & Technology, in particular but not limited to discussions on details of specific licensing terms and conditions.

Finally, the Chairperson should take care that the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s policy guidelines for antitrust compliance are strictly observed.
Throughout the standardization process the Chairperson must take the actions as laid down in the following Sections of this policy document, which facilitate the identification of Essential IPRs.

## 8.1 Define scope statements for work items 
It is vital that the Chairperson ensures that the scope statements for all work items in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s work program are properly defined. This will ensure that if a search for patents is required or chosen to be performed by a Contributor, the task can be carried out in the most effective manner.
In order that the scope statement of a work item can be used for IPR purposes, it should contain the following:
* a broad statement concerning the technical field of this work;
* a description of broad system concepts;
* identification of any standard on which the work item is likely to be based;
* a list of features which the standard will define, or on which the standard will place limitations;
* a technical description of each feature listed, in broad terms; and,
* a list of any criteria which the standard must satisfy.

## 8.2 Make call for IPRs in Work Stream Functionality & Technology meetings 
Every Work Stream Functionality & Technology shall start with a 'Call for IPRs' (either in a written form - as part of the meeting's agenda - or in oral form) performed by the Chairperson. This Call for IPRs acts as a reminder of the Contributor's obligations under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy and is performed to foster the disclosure of Essential IPRs in a timely fashion.

An example of this 'Call for IPRs' may be found below in Section 8.3. 

The Work Stream Functionality & Technology Chairperson is also invited to encourage Contributors to make general IPR undertakings/licensing declarations that they will make licenses available for all their IPRs under FRAND terms and conditions related to a specific standardization area and then, as soon as feasible, provide (or refine) detailed disclosures.

## 8.3 When and How? 
A formal call for IPR disclosures shall be made by the Chairperson at the beginning of each meeting.

The formal call for IPR disclosures needs to be made by the Chairperson orally or in writing according to the example given below. Contributors need to be reminded that the forms for the notification of essential IPRs and licensing declaration are available on-line and attached in Annex {NUMBER} of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Rules & Regulations.

### 8.3.1 Example of a formal call for IPRs 
The attention of the Contributors of this Work Stream Functionality & Technology is drawn to the fact that [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Contributors shall use reasonable endeavours under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy, Annex {NUMBER} of the Rules & Regulations, to inform the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) of Essential IPRs in a timely fashion. This section covers the obligation to notify its own IPRs but also other companies' IPRs. 

The Contributors take note that they are hereby invited:
* to investigate in their company whether their company does own IPRs which are, or are likely to become Essential in respect of the work of the Work Stream Functionality & Technology;
* to notify to the Chairperson or to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) all potential IPRs that their company may own, by means of the IPR Information Statement and the Licensing Declaration forms that they can obtain from the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Chief Technical Officer or {WEBSITE ADDRESS}.

Contributors are encouraged to make general IPR undertakings/declarations that they will make licenses available for all their IPRs under FRAND terms and conditions related to a specific standardization area and then, as soon as feasible, provide (or refine) detailed disclosures.

During the meeting a short reminder call for IPR disclosures should be made:
* on formal submission of a technical solution;
* on completion of the first stable draft of the standard;
* on working group approval of a draft standard;
* on approval of a draft standard by the Review Board.

Such a call may consist of the following sentence 'May I remind Contributors of their obligations to use reasonable endeavours to disclose any Essential lPR related to {ISSUE} in a timely fashion'.

The Work Stream Functionality & Technology Chairperson should note and should make the attendees aware that disclosure of Essential or potentially Essential IPRs should be made at the earliest possible stage within the above list.

Knowing who has contributed to the development of a standard may help identify IPRs Essential to that standard.

If it becomes apparent that an IPR declaration/licensing undertaking is unlikely to be provided, the Work Stream Functionality & Technology Chairperson should inform the [General Counsel](Definitions.md#general-counsel) in the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat), who will take the necessary action.

Ultimately, it may be necessary for the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) to conclude that the necessary licenses are not available, which could require all work on the standard to stop. In any case, the party owning the IPR is allowed three months consideration time after the Work Stream Functionality & Technology has examined the matter and the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) has invited the IPR owner to reconsider its refusal to grant a license. The Chairperson should use his or her judgment (in consultation with the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat)) as to whether or not the Work Stream Functionality & Technology should suspend work on the standard until the matter has been resolved.

## 8.4 Record and report information on IPRs 
The Work Stream Functionality & Technology Chairperson must be particularly careful to record in the report of each meeting that a reminder was issued and include details of any responses that were made. If there were no responses, then this fact should also be recorded.

Whenever a Chairperson becomes aware of the existence of an Essential or potentially Essential IPR he must immediately inform the Legal Advisor of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat).

## 8.5 Copyrights in Specifications 
The Chairperson shall ensure that all technical proposals adopted by the Work Stream Functionality & Technology are recorded in the minutes of the meeting, together with any restrictions on their use, and shall report them to the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat). The [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) will inform the Chairperson if copyright licenses/assignments are required. If so, then they must be obtained before publication of the document. The [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) will determine, with the assistance of the Chairperson, which third party copyrights, if any, have to be acknowledged.

## 8.6 Confidential information 
It may happen that the Chairperson or any of the Work Streams are offered confidential information. There are certain precautions which must be observed. For this reasons, Contributors may be asked to sign with the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) a Mutual Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement. When in doubt in regard to the need, Chairpersons of the Work Streams are strongly urged to contact the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) before proceeding.

# 9 Qiy Foundation's Secretariat Duties 
The [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat), and especially the [General Counsel](Definitions.md#general-counsel), have a general duty to assist the Chairperson in IPR matters. In addition to this, the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) is responsible for the actions below:

## 9.1 Information on Essential IPRs in Specifications 
The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) will ensure that an appropriate reminder of the duty to disclose the identity of Essential IPRs is included in all published Specifications in the form of a standard text.

Specifically, the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) shall ensure that the following marking appears in the Specifications prior to Publication, Contributor vote or Public Enquiry:
### 9.1.1 Intellectual Property Rights
IPRs essential or potentially essential to the present document may have been declared to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). The information pertaining to these essential IPRs, if any, is publicly available for everyone and can be found in {DOCUMENT NUMBER}: 'Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs); Essential, or potentially Essential, IPRs notified to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) in respect of the Qiy Standard', which is available from the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat). Latest updates are available on the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Web server {LOCATION}.

Pursuant to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy, no investigation, including IPR searches, has been carried out by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). No guarantee can be given as to the existence of other IPRs not referenced in {ABOVE DOCUMENT NUMBER} (or the updates on the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Web server) which are, or may be, or may become, essential to the present document.

## 9.2 Non response by an IPR owner to a request for a licensing declaration
In situations where there has been no response from an IPR owner to a request for licensing declaration within three months after an Essential IPR relating to the Qiy Standard or to a particular Specification is brought to the attention of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) or the response is not sufficiently defined, the steps listed in paragraph 9.3 below should be applied.

## 9.3 Procedure to initiate when no licensing declaration can be obtained 
Where no IPR licensing declaration can be obtained because of the refusal by the Essential IPR owner, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) shall initiate a procedure to satisfy itself that a viable alternative technology is available for the Qiy Standard or Specification which:
* is not blocked by that IPR;
* satisfies the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s requirements.

In the case where a viable alternative technology does not exist or is not available, work on the Qiy Standard or the Specification in question shall cease and the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) shall make efforts to resolve the issue. The [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) shall also do his or her utmost to resolve the situation in the case where a license turns out not to be available after the publication of the Qiy Standard or a particular Specification. The Rules & Regulations shall contain the procedures to follow.

## 9.4 Redrafting of Specifications 
The published Qiy Standard or published Specifications should not be redrafted because a change on the essentiality of an IPR arises unless the required licensing declaration has not been provided within the three month period after the above change has been brought to the attention of the [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director), or has been refused. Any IPR changes should be entered into the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Database by the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat), showing the date of the entry.

## 9.5 Acknowledgement of third parties' copyrights 
Due acknowledgment of copyrights owned by third parties, which are identifiable in [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s documentation, must be made in the following form:

Some material contained herein is the copyright of, or has been supplied by ... {NAME OF PARTY IN QUESTION}.

In response to the obligation on the Chairpersons to report to the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) any copyright restrictions in draft documents adopted by their Work Streams, the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) will inform the Chairpersons if copyright licenses/assignments are required. If so, then they must be obtained before publication of the document. The [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) will determine, with the assistance of the Chairperson of the Work Stream which it concerns, which third party copyrights, if any, have to be acknowledged.

## 9.6 Reporting of a substantial IPR problem 
The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Executive Director](Definitions.md#executive-director) should bring any {SUBSTANTIAL?} IPR problem to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Supervisory Board](Definitions.md#supervisory-board) for further discussion.

## 9.7 Maintenance of information on Essential IPRs 
The [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) is responsible for the maintenance of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR online database.?

# 10 Information on Essential IPRs by Qiy Foundation's Secretariat
All information statements and licensing declarations of IPRs received by [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) are publicly available to [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Contributors and to implementers of the Qiy Standard via the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Online Database.

The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Online Database is an application that has been developed by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) to allow electronic online access to Information Statements and Licensing Declarations received by [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s.

The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Online Database contains IPRs, particularly patents and patent applications, which have been notified to [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s as being essential, or potentially essential, to the Qiy Standard.

Unless otherwise specified, all IPRs contained herein have been notified to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation), with a licensing declaration or any other undertaking from the owner to grant licenses according to the terms and conditions as specified in Annex {NUMBER} of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Rules & Regulations.

It is important to note that the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR online database provides data that is based on the information received, i.e.:
* The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) has not checked the validity of the information, nor the relevance of the identified patents/patent applications to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s standards and cannot confirm, or deny, that the patents/patent applications are, in fact, essential, or potentially essential;
* No investigation or IPR searches have been carried out by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) and therefore, no guarantee can be given concerning the existence of other IPRs which are, or may become, essential;
* Potential licensees should use the information in this database at their discretion and should contact the patent holder, for example to establish the status of a disclosed patent family, prior to making a patent licensing decision.

In addition to the entry of new disclosures and undertakings/licensing declarations, existing data in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Database should only be updated based on information received from IPR holders or as the result of a decision by the [Supervisory Board](Definitions.md#supervisory-board), in particular with respect to the following cases:
* Completion of an existing data entry, e.g. the publication number, identification of standard;
* Updating of legal information, such as change of legal status of an IPR (e.g. grant, dropped, revoked or expired), change of ownership of the IPR;
* Addition of information concerning studies performed on the essentiality of an IPR:
* Contributors are obliged to disclose IPRs, which might be essential and [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) is obliged to make these disclosures available to Contributors. This disclosure reflects only an opinion of the Contributor and some facts on the IPRs, but the Contributor is responsible for the content. Any further opinion shall be added only with the agreement of the Contributor or to implement a decision by the [Supervisory Board](Definitions.md#supervisory-board);
* Removal of IPR disclosures at the request of the IPR holder: Contributors are obliged to declare IPRs which they believe to be essential. A licensing declaration or other undertaking for these IPRs shall also be published. The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) is obliged to publish this licensing declaration/undertaking. Any such removal shall be tracked in the IPR on-line database.
* Removal of IPR disclosures in exceptional circumstances: Removals not requested by the IPR holder shall only be performed following a decision taken by the [Supervisory Board](Definitions.md#supervisory-board). Any such removal shall be tracked in the IPR on-line database.

The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Online Database can be found at {WEBSITE LOCATION}.

Whenever requested, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat) shall provide any details on information statements and licensing undertakings/licensing declarations that it has received. The main contact point is the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s [General Counsel](Definitions.md#general-counsel).

IPR information reflected by the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) is based on the information received. [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) has not checked the validity of the information, nor the relevance of the identified patents/patent applications to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s standards and cannot confirm, or deny, that the patents/patent applications are, in fact, essential, or potentially essential. No investigation or IPR searches have been carried out by [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) and therefore, no guarantee can be given concerning the existence of other IPRs which are, or may become, essential.

# 11 Other Qiy Foundation's IPR Policy matters 

## 11.1 Licensing terms and ex ante disclosure 
Specific licensing terms and negotiations are commercial issues between the companies and shall not be addressed within the framework of the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation). The Work Stream Functionality & Technology is not the appropriate place to discuss IPR issues. The Work Stream Functionality & Technology does not have the competence to deal with commercial issues. Contributors participating in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Work Stream Functionality & Technology are often technical experts who do not have legal or business responsibilities with regard to licensing issues. Discussion on licensing issues among competitors in a standards making process can significantly complicate, delay or derail this process.

Without prejudice to [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy and other sections of this policy document, voluntary, unilateral, public, ex ante disclosures of licensing terms by licensors of Essential IPRs, for the sole purpose of assisting Contributors in making informed (unilateral and independent) decisions in relation to whether solutions best meet the technical objectives, are not prohibited under [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Rules & Regulations. Licensing terms from such disclosures may, in some circumstances, improve transparency for individual Contributors in considering technologies for inclusion in the Qiy Standard or Specifications.

No detailed licensing terms should be available from the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) to avoid a misleading impression. The [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) may act as a depository, where IPR owners (licensors) can make available information on how and where to access such disclosed licensing terms, and provide links to URLs of IPR owners, which contain the details of licensing terms and conditions, so that information about the availability of licenses can be disseminated to all users of the Qiy Standard.

However, this provision does not create any obligation for any Contributor to disclose any licensing terms related to any of its IPRs. The lack of disclosure by a Contributor of its licensing terms does not create any implication under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s Rules & Regulations. Specifically, the requested undertaking in writing of an IPR owner that it is prepared to grant licenses on FRAND terms and conditions pursuant to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy is sufficient when selecting technologies for the Qiy Standards and Specifications.

## 11.2 Transfer of Ownership of ESSENTIAL IPRs 
In regard to the transfer of rights and/or the obligation to grant non-exclusive licenses in respect of Essential IPRs under the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy, Contributors and third parties issuing licensing declarations (or similar undertakings) are encouraged to consult with legal counsel when preparing such provisions.

Additionally, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) encourages:
* non-Contributors, including courts, to interpret any FRAND licensing undertaking made pursuant to the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR Policy as an encumbrance that binds all successors-in-interest;
* prospective transferees to check for applicable licensing declarations, for example, by searching for registrations of such declarations in the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)'s IPR database.

## 11.3 Dispute Resolution 
Contributors should attempt to resolve any dispute related to the application of the IPR Policy bilaterally in a friendly manner.

Should this fail, the Contributors concerned are invited to inform the [Supervisory Board](Definitions.md#supervisory-board) in case a friendly mediation can be offered by other Contributors and/or the [Secretariat](Definitions.md#secretariat).

However, it should be noted that once an IPR (patent) has been granted, in the absence of an agreement between the parties involved, the national courts of law have the sole authority to resolve IPR disputes.

## 11.4 Notice on the use of NDAs in IPR negotiations 
It is recognized that non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) may be used to protect the commercial interests of both potential licensor and potential licensee during an Essential IPR licensing negotiation, and this general practice is not challenged. Nevertheless, the [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation) expects its Contributors (as well as non-Contributors) to engage in an impartial and honest Essential IPR licensing negotiation process for FRAND terms and conditions.

1 'Essential IPR' means that it is not possible on technical (but not commercial) grounds, taking into account normal technical practice and the state of the art generally available at the time of standardization, to make, sell, lease, otherwise dispose of, repair, use or operate equipment, software or methods which comply with a Standard without infringing that IPR. Where a Standard can only be implemented by technical solutions, all of which are infringements of IPRs, all such IPRs shall be considered 'Essential'.
