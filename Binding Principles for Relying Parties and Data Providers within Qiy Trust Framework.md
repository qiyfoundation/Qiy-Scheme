# Binding Principles for Relying Parties and Data Providers within Qiy Trust Network 


## Abstract

This document defines the [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle) that apply in respect of all [Data](Definitions.md#data) of [Individuals](Definitions.md#individual) that a [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) and / or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider) come in contact with via the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network). The [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) and / or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider) must respect these [Binding Principles](Definitions.md#binding-principle). The [Access Provider](Definitions.md#access-provider) is, through the [License Agreement Access Provider](Definitions.md#license-agreement-access-provider) required to incorporate these principles into binding contracts with the [Relying Party](Definitions.md#relying-party) and / or [Data Provider](Definitions.md#data-provider). The [Qiy Trust Principles](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-principles) are reflected in a so-called [Charter for Individuals](Definitions.md#charter-for-individual) which seeks to inform the individual persons using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) on their rights.


1. Parties ([Relying Parties](Definitions.md#relying-party) and [Data Providers](Definitions.md#data-provider) can only participate in the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) if they uphold the following principles.

2. An [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) who uses the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) is [Anonymous](Definitions.md#anonymou) until he/she gives permission to be de-anonymized for a specific [Service](Definitions.md#service). 

3. Within the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network), [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) is only shared after explicit and unambiguous permission of the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual). (Permission is either not given, given for single use, or for a limited amount of time).

4. Every [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) informs the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) (in clearly and in easy to understand language) in advance about the purpose for which the [Data](Definitions.md#data) is to be used.

5. Every [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) will not ask for more [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) than necessary for the intended purpose.
	
6. A party using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) will only use [Personal Data](Definitions.md#personal-data) for the exact purpose it has been provided for.

7. A party using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) will only share personal information with third parties after explicit and unambiguous permission of the [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) and only for the purpose the [Data](Definitions.md#data) has been provided for. 

8. Every party using the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) will not store the [Data](Definitions.md#data) for a longer amount of time than necessary for the purpose for which the [Data](Definitions.md#data) has been provided, unless legislation requires this. Essentially, [Data](Definitions.md#data) which are no longer necessary are deleted within six months. The [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) has the right to access and influence his/her provided [Data](Definitions.md#data).

12. Additionally, every party will comply with the [Qiy Trust Network](Definitions.md#qiy-trust-network) in both writing and spirit. 

13. Complaints and disputes

    a.	Complaints and disputes
    
    In case of a complaint or dispute, the first entity to address is the [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider). When this does not lead to an adequate solution, the complaint or dispute can be presented to the [Regional Authority](Definitions.md#regional-authority) (now: [Qiy Foundation](Definitions.md#qiy-foundation)). Every [Service Provider](Definitions.md#service-provider) has a clear place on its website where an [Individual](Definitions.md#individual) can go with his/her complaints and disputes. 

    b.	[Disputes Commission](Definitions.md#disputes-commission)

    When the regional [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority) cannot solve adequately solve the issue, the complaint or dispute can be submitted to the [Disputes Commission](Definitions.md#disputes-commission).

These principles can only be amended by the [Scheme Authority](Definitions.md#scheme-authority).
