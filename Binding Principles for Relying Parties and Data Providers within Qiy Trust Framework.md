# Binding Principles for Relying Parties and Data Providers within the Qiy Trust Network ("Qiy Trust Principles")

Qiy Scheme V1.1


## Abstract

This document lays down the binding principles (the "Qiy Trust Principles") that all Users of the Qiy Scheme must respect when processing personal data via the Qiy Trust Network. This is one of the constitutional documents of the Qiy Scheme. 
Under their licence to operate, that is granted to them by the Scheme Authority (or, in delegation by the Scheme Authority, by a Regional Authority), Access Providers are required to incorporate the Qiy Trust Principles into binding contracts with Relying Parties and/or Data Providers. For this, the Qiy Trust Principles are mirrored in the 'Charter of Individual Rights', which is a separate legal document that must be respected by Relying Parties and Data Providers in their relations with Individuals to the extent that they process personal data of those Individuals. Access Providers can only provide Relying Parties and Data Providers access to the Qiy Trust Network on the basis of a written agreement by which those Relying Parties and/or Data Providers accept to be bound by the "Charter of Individual Rights" in all cases in which they process personal data of Individuals that connect to them via the Qiy Trust Network.

Parties (Relying Parties and Data Providers can only participate in the Qiy Trust Network if they uphold the following principles.

1. An Individual who uses the Qiy Trust Network has the right to share his or her personal data on the basis of a pseudo identity until he or she chooses to accept to be identified for a specific purpose. 

2. Within the Qiy Trust Network, personal data is only shared on the basis of explicit consent of the Individual for each of the specified, explicit and legitimate purposes of the processing for which the personal data is to be processed. This consent shall be obtained when entering into a contractual agreement or on an ad hoc basis before the start of the processing. The processing period for which the explicit consent has been obtained shall be specified or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period.

3. A Data Provider or Relying Party operating under the Qiy Scheme informs the Individual (in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language) in advance about the purpose(s) for which the personal data is to be processed.

4. The quantity and the nature of the personal data requested by a Relying Party operating under the Qiy Scheme shall be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) for which the data is processed.
	
5. A party operating under the Qiy Scheme will only use personal data for the purpose for which this data has been provided for by the individual.

6. A party operating under the Qiy Scheme will not store the data for a longer amount of time than necessary for the purpose for which the data has been provided, unless legislation requires this. 

7. A Data Provider or Relying Party operating under the Qiy Scheme shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay.

8. A party operating on the basis of the Qiy Scheme ensures appropriate security of personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures. 

9. A party operating on the basis of the Qiy Scheme shall accept that  it will be audited periodically according to the rules of the Scheme Authority.

10. A party operating on the basis of the Qiy Scheme shall comply with the rules and regulations, and with the technical standards of the Qiy Scheme.

Complaints and disputes

In the case of a complaint or dispute, the first entity an Individual should be able to address is the Data Provider or Relying Party. 

In the case where this does not lead to an adequate solution, the complaint or dispute can be presented to the Regional Authority (now: Qiy Foundation). A Data Provider or Relying Party shall have a clear and easy to find section on its website where an individual can turn to with his/her complaints and disputes. 

In the case where the Regional Authority cannot adequately solve the issue, the complaint or dispute shall be submitted to the Disputes Committee.

The above Binding Principles for Relying Parties and Data Providers within the Qiy Trust Network can only be amended by the Scheme Authority.
