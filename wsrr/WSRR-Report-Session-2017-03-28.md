  Topic: Review Qiy Trust Principles + Binding Individual Rights 

# 1. Introduction 
The topic of the Work Stream session of 28 March 20 17 was the relationship between the Qiy Scheme and the EU’s General Data Protection Regulat ion (GDPR).  
The objective of the session was to review the Qiy Trust Principles and the Binding Individual Rights in the light of the GDPR and to make recommendation
s for adaptation where necessary. 

# 2. Discussions 
The following issues were addressed: 

Organisations which operate on the basis of the Qiy Scheme accept to be bound by the Binding Individual Rights which are part of the Qiy Scheme. Those Binding Individual Rights represent the general terms and conditions of individuals in regard to the processing of their personal data. Participating organisations’ accept that the Qiy Principles take precedence over their own existing or future privacy statements and that the provisions of these statements that are inconsistent with the Qiy Trust Framework and the Binding Individual Rights will be considered void. Consequently, there may be a discrepancy: users of web services of participating organisations who log on in the traditional way (username and password) accept the privacy statements of the organisation while users who log on with a tool which has been develop ed on the basis of the Qiy Scheme do not. In the latter case the general terms and conditions for the use of personal data under the Qiy Scheme apply. 

Organisations tend to collect personal data not only directly from the users of their services, but also from other sources; they can then link the personal data that they receive from those other sources to the personal data which they received directly from the users. The question arose whether this is acceptable under the Qiy Scheme. The conclusion was that this does not seem to be the case, as the Qiy Scheme requires 'explicit and unambiguous' permission for any type of processing of personal data. 

The question was addressed as to whether 'explicit and unambiguous' permission can be required in the following cases: 
* statutory obligations imposed on organisations to process certain personal data for certain purposes in certain ways and/or for certain periods; 
* where these data are necessary for the provision of a service. 

Under the Qiy Scheme individuals are entitled under all circumstances to maintain their anonymity, even if they choose to share validated data. This provision was thought to be too rigid, as in certain cases individuals cannot interact with service providers without revealing their identity (for example, in relations with government agencies or for certain transactions which require the processing of certain types of personal data). The question arose whether the use of the term ‘anonymity’ is correct; participants though that what is meant is an entitlement to use a ‘pseudo-id’.

Under the Qiy Scheme online tracking is not permitted without the prior permission of the individual concerned. A discussion took place on the definition of online tracking: does it relate only to cross-platform tracking? Or also to tracking on one particular platform. The discussion focused on the question of whether tracking on a single platform should be subject to this requirement. As an example: What if a person contacts a help desk for reason that he or she could not find the answer to his or her question on the website. In that case it is often useful that the helpdesk can track which questions the person has already clicked on, in order to avoid referring to the answers on those questions which, apparently, were not useful for that person.

Under the Qiy Scheme data which are no longer required are to be removed after a period of 6 months, while the GDPR requires that such data are to be removed immediately.

The Qiy Scheme requires an adequate security policy to be implemented, according the requirements imposed by the Global Authority This is thought to be too vague.

The complaints and disputes mechanisms prescribed by the Qiy Scheme may not work in all jurisdictions.


# 3. Recommendations

1. A solution needs to be found to ensure that the same rules apply to the processing of personal data regardless of the log on method. 
2. Rather than determining that the Qiy Principles take precedence over the privacy statements of participating organisations it is recommended that in the case of conflicts, the privacy statement offering the higher protection shall take precedence. 
3. Review the Qiy Scheme requirement of 'explicit and unambiguous' permission for any type of processing of personal data in order to align it with the requirements of the GDPR. 
4. Review the strict requirement of anonymity and replace the notion by an entitlement to use a ‘pseudo-id’ whenever possible. 
5. Allow participating organisations to track the journey of individuals on their platforms in cases where this would give the organisation the possibility to serve them better and faster. A possible solution could be to allow online tracking related to a pseudo-identity only in the case of prior consent of the individual behind that pseudo-identity. In addition, there should be an obligation to inform the individual in the case of online tracking of his or her surfing behaviour on a particular platform. 
6. Insert in the document on Binding Individual Rights a provision clarifying that the Binding Principles also apply. 
7. Align the Qiy Scheme provision that data which are no longer required are to be removed after a period of 6 months, with the GDPR by deleting the 6 month grace period. This should be done by stipulating that personal data can only be processed as long as this is necessary to render the service for which it is necessary to do so. 
8. Review the security policy by referring to the relevant GDPR requirements. 
9. It is recommended to leave room for implementation at regional levels of the requirement of effective dispute resolution mechanisms.
